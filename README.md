# SIBLING WEB BROWSER EXTENSION

## Description
Sibling is a browser extension for Firefox that stores your online behavioural data on your own device and allows you to see what the websites and services you use online know about you.

It exists to help people become more conscious of their online behaviour and understand what data ad networks like Google and Facebook use to create the user's online experience.

Sibling stores user behavioural data on their own devices and will never store this data on their own servers or use/sell this data in any way for any purpose whatsoever. Sibling will capture some data that relates to the use of Sibling, this data is captured transparently and users can view, manage or delete this data at anytime.

### Note:
I am creating this as a learning exercise so some commits on this repo will be exercises that I do to learn as I go. As such some work maybe undone by future commits if it does not serve the purpose of this app.
